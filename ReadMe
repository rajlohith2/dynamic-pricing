The original datasets - 
	transactions.csv.gz - The dataset is too big to be uploaded to canvas - This dataset can be downloaded from my drive at this link - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GdBs_i2_Y4-5rLl-Q9M51TbEp0PMiH6z/view?usp=share_link 
	offers.csv.gz, 
	train.xlsx

The preprocessed dataset - clustered_data_norm.csv 

To preprocess the raw dataset, run preprocessing notebook but it would take almost an hour or more to complete. Sometimes the system might crash if the space is not sufficient. 
Warning - The transactions.csv.gz is a very huge file and thats why it takes almost an hour to get processed because the unziped version is 22GB and zipped version is 3GB.

So the pre-processed dataset is attached in this submission which can be used to run the purchase prediction notebook
